    <p>According to Malone, he chose "Post Malone" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15.[22] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[23] but Malone later explained that "Post" is his last name, and he used a "rap name generator" to get "Malone".[3] At 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches.[24] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[18][25] He was voted "Most Likely to Become Famous" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[18]</p>
